# Bonsai Tracker

The following is a work-in-progress, free, open-source application for tracking and managing a bonsai collection. I have found options which fit many of my desired features, but all have required substantial cost and were missing key features I consider valuable to the bonsai managemnt process. So, I have created an application which fulfills my own needs and can be updated and customized to my liking. The application uses Streamlit and SQLalchemy to create an interactive web application. I hope others are also able to enjoy these advanced features at no cost using my tool. As this project is very much a work in progress, I will outline below which features exist already and which are planned for the near future.

## Existing Features
- Adding a Bonsai tree to your collection
- Adding a new species
- Creating reminders for future actions
- Checking off completed reminders
- Adding photos
- Selecting a primary photo to be displayed on the main page
- Viewing historical photos of each tree
- Automcatically pulling photo date from the photo's metadata
- Viewing a record of work done on a tree
- Adding a tree to the graveyard if it has died
- Deleting a tree
- Backing up all tree photos and data and exporting to a zip file
- Importing data from a backup zip file
- Viewing bonsai trunk width over time

## Features to be added
- Species-specific notes and lessons learned section
- Ability to edit or delete work notes
- Ability to fluidly direct user to appropriate IP for mobile use
- Mobile-friendly check of all relevant features
- General "look and feel" improvements
- Packaging the application as an .exe which can be easily installed by less technical users
- Advanced readme with instructions for installation and use
